## Why Ramadan CLI?

Ramadan CLI is designed to make checking Sehar and Iftar times effortless, with smart defaults and powerful features.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ramadan-First Design" icon="moon">
    Unlike general prayer time apps, Ramadan CLI focuses exclusively on what matters during Ramadan: Sehar (Fajr) and Iftar (Maghrib) times. Clean, focused output without extra noise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic Location Detection" icon="location-dot">
    No manual setup required. The CLI automatically detects your location using IP-based geolocation with multiple fallback providers for reliability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Country-Based Recommendations" icon="compass">
    Automatically recommends the most appropriate calculation method and Asr school based on your country. For example, users in Pakistan get the Karachi method, while North American users get ISNA.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-Time Countdowns" icon="clock">
    See exactly how much time until your next Sehar or Iftar, with automatic timezone detection for accurate countdowns wherever you are.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible Output Modes" icon="display">
    Whether you need today's times, the entire month, a specific day, or a single-line status for your status bar, Ramadan CLI has you covered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent-Friendly" icon="robot">
    Built for both humans and AI agents with JSON output mode, status bar integration, and programmatic configuration options.
